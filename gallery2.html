        <figcaption>Cannonball is a robot I created for my rhythm game projects. He was inspired by Robo Mario and many other robots.
            From the years I've drawn Mario and robots, in 2020, I wanted to make a Mario-like robot myself. I went through iterations
            for the design before settling on this one.
