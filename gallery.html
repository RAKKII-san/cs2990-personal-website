            <p>I drew Mario for an art collaboration I organized for a Super Smash Bros. club in a church.
            This drawing also features Cappy (the cap with eyes on it) from the game Super Mario Odyssey.

            <p>I drew a background for the first time in my digital drawings.
                Mario is the character I drew the most since middle school.

            <p>I started to like drawing robots since I owned Transformers as a kid.
                Though this isn't the first time I've drawn robots here, I'm proud of this drawing I made.<br/>
                Although Metal Sonic (the one on the right) has a backwards hand.<br/>
                The robot on the left is Robo Mario, an obscure robotic doppelganger of Mario.<br/>
                You can learn more about him

            <p>I usually draw fan art related to the Mario franchise, but I'm also trying to branch out a bit.<br/>
                This is Turbo Man, a robot from the game Mega Man 7 who can turn into a racecar.

            <p>Other than drawing, I also create custom levels for a rhythm game called StepMania.<br/>
                I drew this for a background for a song called (This Is Not) The Angels by Hommarju.
